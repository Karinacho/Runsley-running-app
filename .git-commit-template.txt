#     feat!: drop Node 10 support
#     feat(core)!: change API signature
# - Keep the subject (short summary) <= 50 characters and start lowercase
# - Use the body to explain the what and why. Wrap at ~72 characters.
# - Use the footer for breaking changes and/or issue references.
# - Add a Signed-off-by line if you need to certify the DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin).
